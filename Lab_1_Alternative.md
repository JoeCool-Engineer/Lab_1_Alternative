# Progressive Lab: Matrix Operations, Linear Systems, and Independence
### Overview
This lab guides you through the fundamental concepts of matrix operations, building from basic computations to deeper understanding of linear systems and vector independence.

### Part 1: Matrix-Vector Multiplication
#### A. Understanding Row vs Column Perspectives
Consider the matrix A and vector x:
$$ 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: A}
\A = np.array\begin{bmatrix} 
a & b \\ 
c & d 
\end{bmatrix} 
\end{equation}
$$

#### 1. Theory: For this matrix: 
* What does each row represent?

* Why is it called a “difference” matrix? 
* What happens when we multiply it by a vector?
